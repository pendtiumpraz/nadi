Gavi, COVAX, regional procurement blocs, bilateral donation programs, and philanthropic platforms all operate with legitimate mandates and genuine ambition. Yet the absence of a coherent governance architecture means that these efforts frequently duplicate, contradict, or under-resource one another."

Sustainable vaccine governance requires predictable, multi-year financing that is not contingent on annual donor pledging cycles or emergency declarations.
